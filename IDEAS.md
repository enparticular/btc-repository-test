## Ideas for Improvement this small application

- Ideally the application could have a dropdown for selecting different currencies and also different crypto currencies besides BTC. Everytime you select a new currency it would pull the current
- More CSS variables could be added for example for the spacing and gaps in the padding of each element
- I was considering adding a 'Dark Mode' to switch between a dark layout and a standard one. I considered it was a 'nice to have' and it will heavily add more development time for an extra feature not previously requested
